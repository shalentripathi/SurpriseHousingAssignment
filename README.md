## General Information
- This is a advance regression using regularization model building project.
- This project is an acdemic requirement for IIIT-PGPMLAI program.
- This project will help user to identify & quantify features which are impacting house price.
- Historical large dataset on sale price of houses in Australia market based on some factors. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Model shows that GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF, OverallQual, SaleType & YearBuilt are top 5 variables have strong assication with house sale price.
- When GrLivArea (Above grade (ground) living area square feet) value increases sale price increases.
- Sale price is more for higher TotalBsmtSF (Total square feet of basement area).
- High OverallQual (Rates the overall material and finish of the house) value lead to high sale price.
